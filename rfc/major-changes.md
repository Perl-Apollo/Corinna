# Major Changes

Due to the fast-moving nature of this project, we won't note every little
change to the RFC. You can always clone the repo and read the commits.
Instead, we'll cover major changes here.

## August 14, 2021

- First draft of RFC released as markdown in github repo so that pull requests
  can be received. Wiki is noted to primarily be of historical interest.
